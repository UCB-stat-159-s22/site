    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, we recommend you to create a `test` repository just as we did in our previous sessions. You can do this by creating a new folder in the JupyterHub and then `git init`. You can also create a remote repository in GitHub. This is a really good way to creating and pushing to a new repository. In order to do this, go to your GitHub account and create a new repository (preferably make it private and without a README file, since you probably already have some contents in your repository). Remember that you need to add and commit one file to your repository!"

    "We are working in our `main` branch of our repository and then we want to try some new experiments in a new branch. If everything goes well with our experiment, we may wish to merge it to `main`.\n",

    "1. Push to remote from a new branch: push a new file in that branch to the remote repository. What happens when you do this? If you try to `git push` changes in a new branch that you just created, you will receive the following message error `fatal: The current branch <branch name> has no upstream branch`. This is because you have just created the branch in local and no in remote. Instead, the first time you push a file to a new branch you have to do `git push -u origin <branch name>` (See [here](https://careerkarma.com/blog/git-no-upstream-branch/) for more information).\n",
    "1. Switch to `main` again and make changes in a different file.\n",

    "\n",
    "While git is very good at merging, if two different branches modify the same file in the same location, it simply can't decide which change should prevail.  At that point, human intervention is necessary to make the decision.  Git will help you by marking the location in the file that has a problem, but it's up to you to resolve the conflict.  Let's see how that works by intentionally creating a conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, follow the next steps:\n",
    "1. Create a new branch and make some changes to an specific file, let's say `text.txt`. Remember to commit this changes! You can push the changes too, although this is not necessary to reproduce the error in your local repository. \n",
    "1. Comeback to the `main` branch and do some more modifications to the same file `text.txt`. Commit the changes again! \n",

    "1. If you see now the contents of `text.txt`, you will see that both changes are overlapped in the same file (you can just see the contents by using `cat text.txt` or using the Midnight Commander). In order to solve the conflict, you need to edit the file manually and decide with changes to keep. Use any text editor (micro, emacs, etc) to edit such file and keep the changes you want.\n",

    "1. Try to restore previous version of such file by using `git checkout <commit> <filename>`. You will need to specify the stage at which you want to restore the file.

It forces Bob to first do the merge on his machine, so that if there is a conflict in the merge, Bob deals with the conflict manually (git could try to do the merge on the server, but in that case if there's a conflict, the server repository would be left in a conflicted state without a human to fix things up).  The solution is for Bob to first pull the changes."
