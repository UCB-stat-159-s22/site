    " 1. Simple manipulation using the files browser in JupyterLab\n",
    " 1. Using the [Midnight Commander](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_adv_mc.php) from the command shell\n",
    " 1. Using Bash as command-line interface (CUI) from the command shell.\n",
    " \n",
    "The idea is that you get familiar with all these. So, even when you are able to all tasks with at least one of the last three, try to learn how to use the others. For example, the Midnight Commander (`mc` in the terminal) is very handy and fast at the moment of manipulating file,; while for most of the GitHub manipulations we will be using the commands from the shell."
