    "## Part 1: Installation and configuration of miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of installing conda with the full package management system and many Python libraries, we are going to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a minimalist version of conda that included the package management tool and a small number of useful packages. If you already have conda installed in your machine, you may don't need to do this. An easy way to check if conda is installed in your computes is by enter `conda --help` in the terminal. You are also welcome of installing conda from zero by removing all conda directories and installing miniconda. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can install the last version of miniconda depending on you operating system from the [Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). For unix machines, a more simple way of doing this is by using the `wget` command followed by the installer link ([silent installation mode](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html#install-macos-silent)). For example, for a MacOSX machine you can use \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh\n",
    "bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/local/conda\n",
    "```\n",
    "and for a Linux machine\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh\n",
    "bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/local/conda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note for Windows users**\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you are working from a Windows machine, you can directly install Miniconda using the link provided in the website. Most cloud-hosted computing is based on a Unix foundation, which both MacOS and Linux provide out of the box, so some of our instructions fit that workflow a little more easily. But for Windows platforms, Microsoft now officially supports something very similar, which is excellent and we highly encourage you to play with and learn about: [the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).  It provides top-notch Unix functionality next to your regular Windows tools and workflow, and is probably the ideal setup for modern scientific and research computing on Windows. Discussing it in detail is beyond the scope of this course, but we highly encourage you to explore this tool on your own (and let us know how it goes!).\n",

    "```\n",
    "and execute it by `source .bashrc`. After doing this, you will see that now conda is recognized. You can fix this changes by now running `conda init`, so you don't need to worry again about `PATH`. You can see where conda has been installed by typing `which conda` in your terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the configuration of conda inside `.condarc` manually or directly though the shell by using the following commands. In this case, we specify the [channel](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html) used by conda/mamba to download the libraries. \n",

    "## Part 2: Setting the Hub environment in local\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you had installed miniconda, you can create virtual environments from a `yml` file just as we did in the Hub. As a first step, we are going to create a virtual environment with the same configuration we have in the Hub. The configuration file `environment.yml` for the Hub is available at the [site repository for the course](https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-s22/site). Before using `environment.yml` to create a new environment, take a look to the text file and try to identify parts of the file that are not necessary or irrelevant to create the Hub environment; you will have to remove the last lines of the file that include the pip instructions for the requirements of the JupyterBook we use for the website, which are not necessary for the creation of the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can create a the virtual environment with \n",
    "```\n",
    "mamba env create -f environmnent.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can always use `conda env create -f <yml file>`, but mamba is much faster than conda. It will take a few minutes until all the dependencies get installed in your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can activate the environment from the terminal using `conda activate <environment name>`. From there, you can lunch the classical notebook by tipping `jupyter notebook` but you also have installed the JupyterLab, which you can lunch with `jupyter lab`."
