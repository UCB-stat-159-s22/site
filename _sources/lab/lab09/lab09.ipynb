    "Today we are going to construct and deploy our first Jupyter Book! This is an incredible tool that allow us to transform contents in our project such as Jupyter notebooks, markdown files and figures into html and pdf files that can be then shared or even hosted on the web. Even if you haven't use it yet, you had been exposed to Jupyter Book during all the semester: the [course website](https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-s22/site) is the Jupyter Book generated from the [site repository](https://ucb-stat-159-s22.github.io/site/overview.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to put in practice the concepts we had covered in [Jupyter Book 101](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D7jZ9mI-VcU9-s9IEEuGCvQH4rm5Bpwc3xek1Mu_Nak/edit#slide=id.gdffb14669d_0_176). A complete documentation of how to [create your first book](https://jupyterbook.org/start/your-first-book.html) can be found in the Jupyter Book documentation. We recommend you to use these two to create the books for this lab and use the course website as a guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you to use Jupyter book both in the Hub and in the local installation you have in your machine. In this last case, check you have installed `jupyter-book` (either enter `which jupyter-book` or `jupyter-book --help` from the terminal)."

    "\n",
    "1. Create a new sample book using the command `jupyter-book create mynewbook/`.This will create a new template folder with some basic files used to deploy the book. Explore each one of the configuration files, specially `_toc.yml` and `_config.yml`. All these are explained in the tutorial.\n",

    "    1. If you are working in your local machine, you can simply execute `jupyter-book build mynewbook/`.\n",
    "    1. If you are working from the Stat159 Hub, you have to run Sphinx manually. [Here](https://ucb-stat-159-s22.github.io/site/lectures/documentation.html) are the instructions of how to do this. \n",

    "1. Add a new image to your book and use it as the logo of the Jupyter book. \n",
    "1. Add a new reference to `references.bib` and cite such reference in either a markdown or Jupyter notebook in your book. Check that when deployed, the reference appears in the right format in the book. How to add more than one citation at once? You can explore the [Get started with references](https://jupyterbook.org/tutorials/references.html).\n",
    "1. Create a new Jupyter notebook inside your book and add it to the table of contents so it appears in the book. In such library, import a new library that is not already included in `requirements.txt` and add it to it so the notebook runs when the book is build. What is the difference between this `requirement.txt` and the requirement file usually named `environmnet.yml` we were using before?"

All the instructions of how to create a new repository in GitHub with the contents of your book are included there plus and explanation about how the hosting of the Jupyter book works. After following these instructions, you should see your book hosted in `https://<user>.github.io/<myonlinebook>/`. Add this link to the description of your GitHub repository."

Create a new file `.github/workflows/book.yml` with the same contents we have in `book.yml` file in the [site repository](https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-s22/site/blob/main/.github/workflows/book.yml). Notice that in the site we are using `book-requirement.txt` while the default name for the requirement file for Jupyter book is `requirement.txt`. In order to GitHub actions to run without an error, you should standardize the name of the requirement file. \n",
