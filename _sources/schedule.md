# Statistics 159/259: Weekly Plan
## Prof. Pérez and GSI Sapienza , Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley

Below is our current plan for the course.
**This is not a contract:** it is a _plan_, and it may change substantially as the
semester unfolds, especially given extra uncertainties due to COVID-19.

## Content

The table of contents on the left pane has links to lectures and labs. The following are live executable links that use the [nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller) service to give you a current copy from git of the given content, ready to be run in the Spring 2022 Berkeley hub. You can use these links in order to run the content conveniently without manual git work.

### Live links for labs on the Berkeley DataHub

### Assigned Readings

When an assignment consists of multiple articles, you should submit a summary paragraph and idea highlight paragraph _per each separate article_.

* #1, due Jan 31, 2022: [Developing open source scientific practice](https://berkeley-stat159-f17.github.io/stat159-f17/_static/ref/millman-perez.pdf).

* #2, due Feb 14, 2022: Keith Baggerly and the Potti & Nevins Cancer Scandal. These are actually two videos, not reading, but the same format applies (short summary, then idea highlight; in this case only one paragraph of eacy kind is to be submitted, as the 60 minutes video is a short overview meant to give you context, while the talk contains more dense ideas):

    - [2012, 60 minutes segment about Duke Clinical Trials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5sZTNPMQRM) (also [available on vimeo](https://vimeo.com/165142857)).

For this paper, start thinking about reproducibility issues with it. The lead author, [Dr. Chelle Gentemann](), will be our guest lecturer on Feb 23, and she will discuss aspects of this work. Later we will follow up with a reproducibility attempt around this paper.
