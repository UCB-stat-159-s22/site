Once you've become familiar with 1-4, the excellent tutorials that exist about collaborating on github on open-source projects should make sense."

This delays the discussion of an aspect of git called the *index* (often referred to also as the 'staging area') that we will cover later.  Most everyday work in regular scientific practice doesn't require understanding the extra moving parts that the index involves, so on a first round we'll bypass it.  Later on we will discuss how to use it to achieve more fine-grained control of what and how git records our actions."
